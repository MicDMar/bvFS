/* CMSC 432 - Homework 7
 * Assignment Name: bvfs - the BV File System
 * Due: Thursday, November 21st @ 11:59 p.m.
 */


/*
 * [Requirements / Limitations]
 *   Partition/Block info
 *     - Block Size: 512 bytes
 *     - Partition Size: 8,388,608 bytes (16,384 blocks)
 *
 *   Directory Structure:
 *     - All files exist in a single root directory
 *     - No subdirectories -- just names files
 *
 *   File Limitations
 *     - File Size: Maximum of 65,536 bytes (128 blocks)
 *     - File Names: Maximum of 32 characters including the null-byte
 *     - 256 file maximum -- Do not support more
 *
 *   Additional Notes
 *     - Create the partition file (on disk) when bv_init is called if the file
 *       doesn't already exist.

/*
 * int bv_init(const char *fs_fileName);
 *
 * Initializes the bvfs file system based on the provided file. This file will
 * contain the entire stored file system. Invocation of this function will do
 * one of two things:
 *
 *   1) If the file (fs_fileName) exists, the function will initialize in-memory
 *   data structures to help manage the file system methods that may be invoked.
 *
 *   2) If the file (fs_fileName) does not exist, the function will create that
 *   file as the representation of a new file system and initialize in-memory
 *   data structures to help manage the file system methods that may be invoked.
 *
 * Input Parameters
 *   fs_fileName: A c-string representing the file on disk that stores the bvfs
 *   file system data.
 *
 * Return Value
 *   int:  0 if the initialization succeeded.
 *        -1 if the initialization failed (eg. file not found, access denied,
 *           etc.). Also, print a meaningful error to stderr prior to returning.

/*
 * int bv_destroy();

 *        -1 if the clean-up process failed (eg. bv_init was not previously,

/*
 * int bv_open(const char *fileName, int mode);
 *
 * This function is intended to open a file in either read or write mode. The
 * above modes identify the method of access to utilize. If the file does not
 * exist, you will create it. The function should return a bvfs file descriptor
 * for the opened file which may be later used with bv_(close/write/read).
 *
 * Input Parameters
 *   fileName: A c-string representing the name of the file you wish to fetch
 *             (or create) in the bvfs file system.
 *   mode: The access mode to use for accessing the file
 *           - BV_RDONLY: Read only mode
 *           - BV_WCONCAT: Write only mode, appending to the end of the file
 *           - BV_WTRUNC: Write only mode, replacing the file and writing anew
 *
 * Return Value
 *   int: >=0 Greater-than or equal-to zero value representing the bvfs file
 *           descriptor on success.
 *        -1 if some kind of failure occurred. Also, print a meaningful error to

 * int bv_close(int bvfs_FD);
 *
 * This function is intended to close a file that was previously opened via a

 * to the bvfs file system.
 *
 * Input Parameters
 *   fileName: A c-string representing the name of the file you wish to fetch
 *             (or create) in the bvfs file system.
 *
 * Return Value
 *   int:  0 if open succeeded.
 *        -1 if some kind of failure occurred (eg. the file was not previously
 *           opened via bv_open). Also, print a meaningful error to stderr

 * Input Parameters
 *   bvfs_FD: The identifier for the file to write to.
 *   buf: The buffer containing the data we wish to write to the file.
 *   count: The number of bytes we intend to write from the buffer to the file.
 *
 * Return Value
 *   int: >=0 Value representing the number of bytes written to the file.
 *        -1 if some kind of failure occurred (eg. the file is not currently
 *           opened via bv_open). Also, print a meaningful error to stderr

 *
 * Input Parameters
 *   bvfs_FD: The identifier for the file to read from.
 *   buf: The buffer that we will write the data to.
 *   count: The number of bytes we intend to write to the buffer from the file.
 *
 * Return Value
 *   int: >=0 Value representing the number of bytes written to buf.
 *        -1 if some kind of failure occurred (eg. the file is not currently

 *
 * Input Parameters
 *   fileName: A c-string representing the name of the file you wish to delete
 *             from the bvfs file system.
 *
 * Return Value
 *   int:  0 if the delete succeeded.
 *        -1 if some kind of failure occurred (eg. the file does not exist).

/*
 * void bv_ls();
 *
 * This function will list the contests of the single-directory file system.
 * First, you must print out a header that declares how many files live within
 * the file system. See the example below in which we print "2 Files" up top.
 * Then display the following information for each file listed:
 *   1) the file size in bytes
 *   2) the number of blocks occupied within bvfs
 *   3) the time and date of last modification (derived from unix timestamp)
 *   4) the name of the file.
 * An example of such output appears below:
 *    | 2 Files
 *    | bytes:  276, blocks: 1, Tue Nov 14 09:01:32 2017, bvfs.h
 *    | bytes: 1998, blocks: 4, Tue Nov 14 10:32:02 2017, notes.txt
 *
 * Hint: #include <time.h>
 * Hint: time_t now = time(NULL); // gets the current unix timestamp (32 bits)
 * Hint: printf("%s\n", ctime(&now));
 *
 * Input Parameters
 *   None
 *
 * Return Value
 *   void
